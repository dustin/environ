# Welcome to Environ

This is an erlang program I wrote that, combined with my 1wire suite, provides
near-realtime alerting of sensors going out of state (or just falling off the
network) so I can know when I need to buy a new air conditioner for my machine
room.

It also provides a simple TCP mirroring that will show you data as it comes in
on the wire.  For a good time, telnet to lemp.west.spy.net port 8181.

Don't ask me what lemp stands for.  I forgot pretty much as soon as I wrote it.
